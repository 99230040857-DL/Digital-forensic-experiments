# Experiment 7 
# Android Device Forensic Acquisition using ADB Logical Backup

---
## Aim
To perform logical acquisition of data from an Android device using Android Debug Bridge (ADB) backup functionality.

---

## Description
This experiment demonstrates the forensic acquisition of data from an Android device using ADB's built-in backup functionality. The process includes creating a logical backup, verifying its integrity through hashing, and analyzing the extracted contents while maintaining forensic principles.

---
## Tools Used
1. Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
2. Android Device
3. USB Cable
4. Android Backup Extractor (abe.jar)
      .Download Android Backup Extractor from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor/releases/tag/latest
   ```
5. SHA256 hashing tool

---
## Prerequisites
1. Android device with:
   - USB debugging enabled
   - At least 50% battery life
   - Device unlocked and screen active
2. Computer with:
   - ADB installed and configured

---
## Procedure

### 1. Device Connection and Verification
1. Connect Android device via USB
2. Verify connection using ADB:
```powershell
   adb devices

<!-- [Insert Screenshot: ADB devices list output] -->

3. Check device details:
```powershell
   adb shell getprop ro.product.model
   adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release

```<img width="939" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a6b8bb-60f5-49d3-9262-c76928a7e652" />

<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Device properties output] -->

### 2. Creating Full ADB Logical Backup
1. Create full backup including shared storage:
```powershell
   adb backup -f device_backup.ab -all -system -shared -apk
```

<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Backup creation dialog on device] -->

2. Monitor backup progress:
```powershell
   dir device_backup.ab
```

<!-- [Insert Screenshot: File size and creation time] -->

### 3. Backup Integrity Verification
1. Generate SHA256 hash of backup file:
```powershell
   certutil -hashfile device_backup.ab SHA256
```
<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Hash output] -->

### 4. Creating External Storage Only Backup
1. Verify connection using ADB:
```powershell
   adb devices
```

<img width="1153" height="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d5d2a7-39e1-4823-afbd-7acea74a0e14" />
<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Shared storage backup dialog] -->

2. Find the external storage path:
```powershell
   adb shell ls /storage
```
   You'll see something like:
emulated  self  XXXX-XXXX
The one with numbers (e.g. XXXX-XXXX) is your SD card.


<img width="1153" height="178" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ac9d2b3-65b3-48ad-a845-ac6d66347462" />

3. Create a backup folder on the host computer, for example:
```poweshell
   mkdir D:\android_backup
```

4. Back up only the SD card folder:
Replace XXXX-XXXX with your card ID:
```powershell
   adb pull /storage/XXXX-XXXX D:\phone_backup\
```
ðŸ”¹ This copies only SD card contents to your laptop (folder D:\android_backup\).
ðŸ”¹ It wonâ€™t touch internal storage or system data.

5. Verify backup creation:

6. Compare sizes of full backup vs shared storage backup:

### 5. Converting Backup to TAR Format
1. Download Android Backup Extractor (abe.jar)
2. Convert .ab file to .tar:
```powershell
   tar -cvf sd_backup.tar "C:\Users\K CHANDRA SEKHAR\backup"
```

<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Conversion process output] -->

### 6. Extracting Backup Contents
1. Extract TAR archive:
```powershell
   tar -xvf sd_backup.tar -C D:\extracted_backup\
```

<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Extraction process] -->

2. List extracted contents:
```powershell
   dir extracted_backup /s
```
<!-- [Insert Screenshot: Directory listing] -->

### 7. Data Analysis

1. Common locations to examine:
   - apps/com.android.providers.contacts/d_*/databases/contacts2.db
   - apps/com.android.providers.telephony/d_*/databases/mmssms.db
   - apps/com.android.providers.media/d_*/databases/external.db

2. Analyze database contents using SQLite Browser

---
## Results
Document the following findings:
1. Backup File Details:
   - Size: [Size in MB]
   - Creation Time: [Timestamp]
   - SHA256 Hash: [Hash value]

2. Extracted Content Statistics:
   - Number of applications: [Count]
   - Total files extracted: [Count]
   - Key databases found: [List]
